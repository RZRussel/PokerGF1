# Texas Hold'em
Console User vs Bot poker game

#What new?

-	Full Texas Hold'em game flow implementation added except some winner decision edge cases
-   Console game interface implementation added
-	Simple bot logic, which we call 'Always YES', added

#TODO

- Complete edge cases in winner detection logic
- Make user input in the game interface more friendly
- Separate 'bet' from 'raise' in game interface
- Improve bot logic to be more smart mixing rule-based and formula-based math methods.
